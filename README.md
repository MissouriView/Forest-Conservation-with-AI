# Forest-Conservation-with-AI #
This is a 2-week course module on teaching AI for forest conversation, ideal for undergrad and graduate courses. The course module was developed based the publication below. 

   - Cota, G., Sagan, V., Maimaitijiang, M., and Freeman, K. (2021). Forest conservation with deep learning: A deeper understanding of human geography around the Betampona Nature Reserve, Madagascar.  Remote Sens., 13(17), 3495; doi: [10.3390/rs13173495](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13173495).

This repository contains scripts for three different parts - part 1 for data preprocessing, training a CNN model, and application of the model to WV-3 imagery; part 2 includes scripts for pixel-based machine/deep learning algorithms (SVM, RF, and DNN) available only to instructors who would like to use this material for their machine learning course; and part 3 includes a tutorial for forest change analysis using grid-cell approach.

The goal of this repository is to create a tropical forest map (with other land cover/use type) using U-Net as the segmentation algorithm.  The imagery used is WorldView-3 (WV-3), which contains 16 bands (8 bands in the visible region and 8 bands in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region).

[Cota et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.3390/rs13173495) used a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) as an end-to-end pixel-based (SVM, RF, and DNN) and patch-based (CNN) image classifier of high-resolution satellite imagery, which was one of the very first implementation of GeoAI to forest conservation and human geography.
