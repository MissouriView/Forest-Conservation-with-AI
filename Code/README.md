This folder contains scripts for three different parts - part 1 for data preprocessing, training a CNN model, and application of the model to WV-3 imagery; part 2 includes scripts for pixel-based machine/deep learning algorithms (SVM, RF, and DNN) available only to instructors who would like to use this material for their machine learning course; and part 3 includes a tutorial for forest change analysis using grid-cell approach.

Part 2 is assignment for students. We provide instructor solutions if needed upon request.
